# helpful_scripts
Scripts and templates that I find helpful

log.pl - A script to assist in task management.  Call the script to log a note or publish the logged notes
perl_template.pl - Template I typically use to write perl scripts with.  Can be used as a Perl "modulino"
python_template.pl - Template I wrote recently for python scripts I'll write.
